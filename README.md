# **Customer Service Call Center Forecast**

## **Introduction**

A common business problem for busy call centers are call volume peaks and valleys where business operations and employee staffing levels are not optimized for peak calling periods. For this example project I built a Call Center Forecasting tool to predict call volume by day for a 30 day horizon. I visualized the forecasted daily call volume in addition to Call Center KPIs in a Tableau Dashboard. A call center can use the forecast and dashboard to increase efficiencies in their Operations. Employee work hours and overtime can be more efficiently distrbuted during high volume call hours. 

### **Steps:**

* Created a tool that forecasts call center data gathered from Kaggle to increase efficiencies in Call Center Operaions
* Compared traditional and nontraditional time-series models to the LightGBM Regressor
* Engineered features to increase Mean Squared Error score for future forecast
* Optimized LightGBM Regressor to forecast Daily Calls
* Built client dashboard in Tableau Public to visualy display timeseries forecast and other KPIs
