## **Project One: Call Center Forecast**

* Created a tool that forecasts call center data gathered from Kaggle to increase efficiencies in Call Center Operaions
* Engineered features to increase Mean Squared Error score for future forecast
* Optimized LightGBM Regressor to forecast Daily Calls
* Built client dashboard in Tableau Public to visualy display timeseries forecast and other KPIs

## **Project Overview**
For this example project I built a Call Center Forecasting model using the LigthGBM Regressor model. I visualized the forecasted daily call volume in addition to Call Center KPIs in a Tableau Dashboard. A call center can use the forecast and dashboard to increase efficiencies in their Operations. Employee work hours and overtime can be more efficiently distrbuted during high volume call hours.
